# SJTU-CS356
Course design for CS256 in SJTU, including 8 projects.

Project1: Introduction to Linux kernel modules

Project2: Unix shell & Linux kernel module for task information

Project3: Multithread sorting application & Fork-Join sorting application

Project4: Scheduling Algorithms

Project5: Designing a thread pool & The producer-consumer problem

Project6: Banker's algorithm

Project7: Continuous memory allocation

Project8: Designing a virtual memory manager

Each project is included in a folder indicating its index. In each project folder, I uploaded relating *.c files
and a report about coding details and my initial thoughts about these projects. 
There may also be some instructions about the way to compile these *.c files in the reports (tools like gcc).

According to the deadline in my semester, I may not be able to write these codes very clearly and readably, 
but some comments in the codes may be useful. If you have any question, welcome to contact with me.

For more details, please read the book Operating System Concepts (10th edition), the projects above are all from this book.
